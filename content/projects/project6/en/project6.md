**Project Description:** Users' travel is closely related to their social habits, so the traffic user trajectory network has social attributes. We perform user trajectory feature extraction and KOL modeling on the transportation network, which enables us to profile each user of the transportation network. Therefore, in the event of major events such as security or epidemic prevention and control, we can monitor the flow of people in advance, predict traffic transmission, and track potential super-spreaders.
