**Project Description:** The performance characteristics of mobile phone amplifiers, transistors, etc. are hidden in the transmitted signal of the mobile phone, which is called the fingerprint information of the radiation source. Each radiation source has inherent identity uniqueness. We hope to effectively extract the fingerprint feature information of the radiation source signal and identify and detect the radiation source. The whole problem is divided into two parts: radiation source signal extraction and fingerprint information mining.
