**Project Description**: This project is based on the **KOL user model** of Internet social network platforms. It uses scientific methods to extract the behavioral characteristic parameters of different types of users in large and complex networks, and studies the information transmission effect in the network. The KOL network model will provide analytical methods to mine the interaction relationships between users in Internet social platforms, thereby controlling information dissemination channels, and identifying special users and fake news.
